    text1: "To conclude, surprisingly it seems easier to win when the person targeted belongs to 'other ethnicities'. The origin of this bias does not seem to be due to Wikispeedia but more to general knowledge. Indeed, sentiment analysis shows no difference in the way pages are written, and the distribution of links leans towards an inequality in favour of whites people. Although the bias in the victory is in favour of others ethnicity, there is still an inequality in the representation others ethnicities people within the game and in the number of links to access these pages. Moreover, the causal analysis should be consider carefully, as only one matching was made on the basis of the propensity score. Some confounders are difficult to determine due to a lack of data, such as player level.",
