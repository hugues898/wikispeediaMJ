Indeed, as presented below, this distribution is clearly unequal. This makes us realize that players are more likely to target a white person than someone of another ethnicity. This is explained on the one hand by a general culture of society turned towards the West and therefore Caucasian people but also by the greater emphasis on white people in the Wikispeedia game.",
